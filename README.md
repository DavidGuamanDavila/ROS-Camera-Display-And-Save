## Description
This ROS (Robot Operating System) package is designed to subscribe to a camera feed topic, display the image using OpenCV, and save the image to a file. It utilizes ROS publishers and subscribers, OpenCV for image handling, and cv_bridge for converting between ROS image messages and OpenCV image representation.

## Features
- **ROS Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the ROS ecosystem.
- **Image Display**: Utilizes OpenCV to display images from a camera feed in real-time.
- **Image Saving**: Saves the camera feed images to the file system.

## Requirements
- ROS (compatible with the version you are using, e.g., ROS Noetic)
- OpenCV (compatible with the version included in your ROS distribution)
- cv_bridge (typically included with ROS distributions)
